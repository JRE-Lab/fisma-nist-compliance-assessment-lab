# FISMA/NIST Compliance Assessment Lab

This repository contains materials for a FISMA/NIST compliance assessment lab. The goal of the lab is to guide students through the process of bringing an information system into compliance with the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) and the NIST SP 800‑53 control catalog.

## Overview

In this lab you will:

- **Understand FISMA and the RMF:** Learn about FISMA’s requirement for each federal system to have an information security program and how the NIST RMF applies a seven‑step lifecycle (prepare, categorize, select, implement, assess, authorize and monitor) to manage risk and achieve compliance.
- **Categorize the system:** Using FIPS 199 impact levels (low, moderate or high), categorize a sample information system based on the potential impact of confidentiality, integrity and availability breaches.
- **Conduct a risk assessment:** Identify threats and vulnerabilities, determine the likelihood and impact of exploitation and prioritise risks for treatment.
- **Select and tailor controls:** Choose baseline security controls from NIST SP 800‑53 appropriate to the system’s impact level and tailor them to the system’s specific environment. Document control selection and justification in a System Security Plan (SSP).
- **Implement and document controls:** Configure technical controls such as access control, encryption, logging, firewalls and intrusion detection systems. Develop policies and training to satisfy procedural control requirements. Update the SSP to reflect implementation details.
- **Assess and authorize:** Evaluate whether controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended and producing the desired security outcome. Prepare an authorization package for the Authorizing Official to make a risk‑based decision to issue an Authority to Operate (ATO).
- **Continuous monitoring:** Establish a strategy for ongoing assessment of controls, vulnerability management, incident response and configuration management. Keep artifacts, logs and training materials up to date for future audits.

All steps in this lab use publicly available guidance from NIST and other U.S. federal standards. No sensitive or proprietary information is required.
