+# Lab 04: Implement (RMF Step 3)
+
+## Purpose
+
+Document how the selected controls are implemented in the CCP system.
+
+## Objectives
+
+- Describe technical, operational, and management control implementation.
+- Capture evidence sources and responsible owners.
+- Update the SSP with implementation statements.
+
+## Tasks
+
+1. Populate the SSP template with system description and boundary.
+2. For each selected control, describe the implementation approach.
+3. Identify evidence artifacts (logs, configs, screenshots, policies).
+4. Note any implementation gaps for the POA&M.
+
+## Deliverables
+
+- Draft System Security Plan (SSP)
+- Evidence inventory list
+- Initial POA&M entries
+
+## Checkpoint questions
+
+- Which controls are partially implemented or planned?
+- What operational procedures support the technical controls?
