+
+## Purpose
+
+Select and tailor baseline controls from NIST SP 800-53 based on the system categorization.
+
+## Objectives
+
+- Choose the baseline (Low/Moderate/High) controls.
+- Tailor controls to the CCP environment.
+- Record justification for any overlays or scoping decisions.
+
+## Tasks
+
+1. Identify the baseline control set for the system impact level.
+2. Use `templates/control-traceability.csv` to map controls to system components.
+3. Identify at least five controls that need tailoring or enhancement.
+4. Document scoping decisions (e.g., not applicable controls).
+
+## Deliverables
+
+- Control selection worksheet
+- Tailoring rationale notes
+- Initial control traceability matrix
+
+## Tips
+
+- Prioritize access control, audit logging, encryption, and configuration management.
+- Capture control dependencies in the traceability matrix.
