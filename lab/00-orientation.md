+# Lab 00: Orientation
+
+## Purpose
+
+Set the foundation for the lab, review the scenario, and prepare artifacts you will maintain throughout the RMF lifecycle.
+
+## Scenario recap
+
+You are the security lead for the **CivicAccess Case Portal (CCP)**, a cloud-hosted case management system used by a federal program office. The system stores PII, supports external partner access, and integrates with a legacy data warehouse.
+
+## Objectives
+
+- Confirm the system boundary and identify key stakeholders.
+- Identify the data types handled by the system.
+- Review the lab artifacts and templates.
+
+## Tasks
+
+1. Read `data/system-facts.md` to understand the system.
+2. Draft a short system boundary statement (2-3 paragraphs).
+3. Identify the mission/business owner, system owner, and authorizing official.
+4. Create a working folder for your artifacts and copy the templates from `templates/`.
+
+## Deliverables
+
+- System boundary statement
+- Stakeholder list with roles and responsibilities
+- Checklist of lab artifacts you will produce
+
+## Checkpoint questions
+
+- What external systems or services are in-scope?
+- Which data types are in-scope and which are explicitly out of scope?
