+# Lab 02: Categorize (RMF Step 1)
+
+## Purpose
+
+Apply FIPS 199 and SP 800-60 to determine the system impact level for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
+
+## Objectives
+
+- Identify the information types processed by CCP.
+- Assign impact levels for each security objective.
+- Produce a FIPS 199 categorization memo.
+
+## Tasks
+
+1. List the information types in `data/system-facts.md`.
+2. For each information type, assess potential impacts (Low/Moderate/High).
+3. Determine the overall system categorization using the high-water mark.
+4. Draft a 1-2 page categorization memo.
+
+## Deliverables
+
+- FIPS 199 categorization memo
+- Table of information types with impacts
+
+## Checkpoint questions
+
+- Which information type drives the highest impact level?
+- What mission impact would result from a loss of availability?
